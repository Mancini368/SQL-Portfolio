Welcome to my SQL portfolio!
This repository contains SQL I've written using MySQL and BigQuery to create schemas, write queries and my process analyzing data with SQL using functions including SUM, AVG, COUNT, aliasing, FORMAT TIMESTAMP, EXTRACT, JOIN, CASE, Subqueries, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and PARTITION BY.

You can also find the vizualizations for these analysis and others vizualizations on my Tableau page: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/melissa6284
